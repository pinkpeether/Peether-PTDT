## 01 — The Crisis
### Blockchain Is Solving the $1 Trillion Mobility Crisis


The global mobility market is worth over $1 trillion annually, yet it's plagued by inefficiencies, exploitation, and environmental harm.

Centralized ride-hailing giants have created a broken system where neither drivers nor passengers truly benefit.

Uber and Lyft take **25-30% of every fare**. Drivers work longer hours for less money. Riders face unpredictable surge pricing during peak hours. In 2024 alone, Uber generated $37 billion in revenue — yet the average driver earned just **$19 per hour** after expenses.

Meanwhile, traditional taxi services struggle with outdated payment systems, lack of transparency, and safety concerns. Women passengers, in particular, face disproportionate safety risks.

#### Where Does Your Fare Go?
The ugly truth about ride-hailing economics

$100 Rider Pays →

- **$30** Platform (30%) 🏢
- **$70** Driver (70%) 👤
- **~$50** After Costs (~50%) 💰

**Winner? Not the driver. Not you.**  
Only the billion-dollar platforms win.

## 03 — The Numbers
### Why 100,000 Supply Changes Everything

#### Supply Comparison
| Token     | Total Supply       | Notes                  |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **PTDT** | **100,000**       | Ultra-scarce          |
| Bitcoin  | 21,000,000        | 210× more supply      |
| Ethereum | ∞                 | Unlimited supply      |

PTDT's ultra-scarce supply creates a unique value proposition. With only **100,000 tokens ever to exist**, PTDT is significantly scarcer than most cryptocurrencies. As adoption grows, demand meets a fixed, immutable supply.

**2,100×** Scarcer than Bitcoin  
100K vs 21M max supply

#### Market Cap Projections
| Token Price | Market Cap |
|-------------|------------|
| $1         | $100K     |
| $10        | $1M       |
| $100       | $10M      |
| $1,000     | $100M     |

## 05 — Impact
### Empowering Women Through Blockchain

PTDT's integration with Pink Taxi fleets isn't just about technology — it's about **economic freedom for women drivers** in emerging markets where traditional employment opportunities are limited.

When drivers earn more and riders pay less, everyone wins. When safety is hardcoded into smart contracts instead of dependent on corporate PR responses, women's lives are literally protected.

This is what blockchain was meant to do: **remove intermediaries, increase transparency, and empower individuals**.
